# Lydi
My first Android app! For musicians who want some help with practicing their scales. Currently a WiP

Users are first taken to the main screen seen below. They then can either load in a previously created scale set, or create a new one. Once they've created and selected a scale set, they are shown the scales randomly at the time interval that they chose (in seconds).
