My first Android app! For musicians who want some help with practicing their scales. Currently a WiP

When trying to learn my scales, I found that playing them in a random order was the best way to memorize them as indenpendent entities. I created this app so that I could pick any set of scales I wanted to work on and then have it randomly show me a scale every X amount of seconds. I also added a feature that makes it possible to save and load scale sets.
